# ESP8266
The ESP8266 is a low cost 32 bit RISC microcontroller from Espressif 
-Single core CPU
-Up to 80MHz clock speed
-4 MB Flash memory 
-A lot of interfaces like UART / I2C
-Build in wifi

In this tutorial , I am using wemos D1 mini device. This is a ESP8266 microcontroller on a small board with micro USB(USB to UART) and connections for extend boards.
